# logistic_regression_diabetes
This is a continuation of (https://github.com/drchubbington/logistic_regression_with_gradient_descent). It uses multivariate logistic regression to diagnose diabetes among patients. This program takes 8 values regarding a patient (including age, insulin, and BMI) and decides whether the patient had diabetes based on its model.
